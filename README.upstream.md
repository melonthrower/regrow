# GUI-ReWalk

## Local deployment

For the maintained screenshot-only visual traversal entry point, use
[DEPLOY_LOCAL.md](DEPLOY_LOCAL.md). The Git repository intentionally excludes
VMware images, model weights, runtime outputs, and credentials.

## Maintained repository layout

- `gui_rewalk/src/core/visual_traversal/` contains the runtime. Canonical agent
  roles are under `agents/`, region registry/scroll behavior under
  `grounding/region/`, navigation
  policy/router code under `navigation/`, and effective VLM prompts under
  `prompts/`. Historical root modules remain only where compatibility is needed.
- `tests/` contains offline regression tests. `tools/` contains operator and
  analysis utilities; it is not a test directory.
- `artifacts/` is the ignored runtime-output boundary. New visual traversals
  default to `artifacts/runs/`; see `artifacts/README.md`.
- `data/imported/` and `data/evaluation/` hold imported and evaluation datasets.
  `collections/`, `research/`, and `issues/` hold durable data or evidence and
  are not interchangeable with disposable runtime artifacts. Paper work lives
  under `research/paper/`; dated notes and handoffs live under `research/history/`.

Run the focused structural regression suite from the repository root:

```bash
python -B -m pytest -q tests/test_prompt_catalog.py tests/test_frontier_policy.py tests/test_architecture_boundaries.py
```

Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, powered by large language and vision-language models, hold promise for enabling end-to-end automation in digital environments. However, their progress is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of scalable, high-quality trajectory data. Existing data collection strategies either rely on costly and inconsistent manual annotations or on synthetic generation methods that trade off between diversity and meaningful task coverage. To bridge this gap, we present **GUI-ReWalk**—a reasoning-enhanced, multi-stage framework for synthesizing realistic and diverse GUI trajectories. GUI-ReWalk begins with a stochastic exploration phase that emulates human trial-and-error behaviors, and progressively transitions into a reasoning-guided phase where inferred goals drive coherent and purposeful interactions. Moreover, it supports multi-stride task generation, enabling the construction of long-horizon workflows across multiple applications. By combining randomness for diversity with goal-aware reasoning for structure, GUI-ReWalk produces data that better reflects the intent-aware, adaptive nature of human-computer interaction. We further train GUI-ReWalk-7B on the our dataset and evaluate it across multiple benchmarks, including Screenspot-Pro, OSWorld-G, UI-Vision, AndroidControl, and GUI-Odyssey. Results demonstrate that GUI-ReWalk enables superior coverage of diverse interaction flows, higher trajectory entropy, and more realistic user intent. These findings establish GUI-ReWalk as a scalable and data-efficient framework for advancing GUI agent research and enabling robust real-world automation.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Human-like GUI Modeling** We formalize GUI trajectories as a hierarchical Markov Decision Process, where each stride combines subgoal abstraction with stride-based reasoning to capture both exploratory and goal-directed behaviors.  


- **The GUI-ReWalk framework**: We introduce a multi-stage framework integrating random exploration, task-guided completion, and cross-application task initiation, enhanced by retrospective LLM-based annotation and error-recovery mechanisms that mirror real human interaction patterns.

- **Dataset analysis and model evaluation**: We provide an in-depth analysis of the GUI-ReWalk dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness by training GUI-ReWalk-7B, which achieves substantial improvements across grounding and navigation benchmarks.

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gui-rewalk.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📋 Tutorial

### 1. Download VMware-Fusion

Install VMware Workstation Pro (for systems with Apple Chips, you should install VMware Fusion) and configure the vmrun command. The installation process can refer to How to install VMware Workstation Pro. Verify the successful installation and check the path to vm by running the following:

```bash
vmrun -T ws list
```

### 2. Prepare Environment

#### 2.1 Install OSWorld

```bash
# Clone the GUI-ReWalk repository
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/GUI-ReWalk

# Change directory into the cloned repository
cd GUI-ReWalk

# Clone the OSWorld repository
git clone https://github.com/xlang-ai/OSWorld.git
cd OSWorld

# Optional: Create a Conda environment for GUI-ReWalk
conda create -n rewalk python=3.10
conda activate rewalk

# Install required dependencies of osworld first
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install desktop-env
pip install -e .
```




Test OSWorld with the official osworld testing script ([quickstart.py](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OSWorld/blob/main/quickstart.py)) (this will automatically download an Ubuntu image and open it in VMware; you may need to grant some permissions to VMware):


#### 2.2 Install OmniParser

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser.git
cd OmniParser
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download the model checkpoints to local directory OmniParser/weights/
for f in icon_detect/{train_args.yaml,model.pt,model.yaml} icon_caption/{config.json,generation_config.json,model.safetensors}; do huggingface-cli download microsoft/OmniParser-v2.0 "$f" --local-dir weights; done
mv weights/icon_caption weights/icon_caption_florence
```

### 3. Run GUI-ReWalk

```bash
bash run_rewalk.sh
```
